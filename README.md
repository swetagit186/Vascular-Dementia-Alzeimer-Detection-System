# Vascular-Dementia-Alzeimer-Detection-System
This repository contains code, and models developed for the study and classification of **Vascular Dementia (VaD)**. The project integrates **clinical, demographic, cognitive, and behavioral patient metadata** with **DICOM neuroimaging data** to build and evaluate machine learning and deep learning models for improved diagnosis and analysis.

## Project Overview

Vascular dementia is one of the most common causes of cognitive decline after Alzheimerâ€™s disease.  
The goal of this project is to:

- Collect and preprocess **structured patient metadata** (clinical, demographic, cognitive, behavioral, test scores).  
- Process **DICOM neuroimaging data** and integrate with patient metadata.  
- Build machine learning and deep learning models for **disease classification and analysis**.  
- Provide a **Streamlit-based application** for visualization and prediction.
